                voice that had <br> 
                of Captain Richard<br> 
                Runeberg's office,<br> 
                and - though this<br> 
                should have seemed<br> 
                His being there<br> 
                arrested or <br>
                on this same day, I <br>
                implacable. Rather, <br> 
                obliged to be <br>

                piece of luck: the <br> 
                the deaths of two 
            </p>

            <p class="Red">I went up to my bedroom. Absurd though the gesture was, I closed and locked the door. I threw myself down on my narrow iron bed, and waited on my back. The never changing rooftops filled the window, and the hazy six o'clock sun hung in the sky. It seemed incredible that this day, a day without warnings or omens, might be that of my implacable death. In despite of my dead father, in despite of having been a child in one of the symmetrical gardens of Hai Feng, was I to die now?</p>

            <p class="Darkred">Then I reflected that all things happen, happen to one, precisely now. Century </p>
